# Challenge or Problem Overview

In our study, we could see that Curly Hair has become a trend. Our Research shows that research on the internet to find items about Curly Hair has increased by 55% in the last two years (Google BrandLab). But at the same time, many women don’t use natural hair because they don’t know exactly how to take care of their hair. 

That’s why many of them use Youtube to follow an influencer and learn it. Especially women who live in other countries where curly hair is usually not common, because of that it can be so hard to find some products to buy. In this sense, our app will help you find products for your hair, given your preferences and in whatever country you live in or travel. It will provide a platform to find a specific curly store or products you are looking for.

## Research & Analysis
Our team wanted to learn how women use digital tools to find and choose the best products for their curly hair. At the same time, since this is a new product, we want to identify opportunities and understand why many women don’t use their hair naturally, whether it’s due to a lack of knowledge or other reason.

## Concepts & Sketching
As our app was in the early stage we’ve decided to create only 2 main features: Find Products and Learn more. When the user chooses “Find Products” it automatically shows some stores nearby, but the user can also search for a specific store as well. And it is possible for users to “Save” these stores. When the user clicks on the button “Learn more”, it’s possible to see some content about specific treatments.

## Prototyping
It is the first prototyping of low-fidelity development to see how the app will work.

## Validation, Usability, Feedback

In our Usability test, we wanted to understand how the users navigated through all the main processes of the app. The task point was:

- **Enter application** (In this section the user did not understand what the application was about before the login.)
- **Recognize the features** (The users understood the features).
- **Navigate through the screens** (The users thought it was easy to navigate through the screens. But the users clicked in some features that were not implemented).
- **Identify the process** (The users did not see the checkbox to save the store).

It was good to see how the user interacts with the app in this first stage, and at the same, we could see some points that are necessary for improvements and about the failure to find some solutions.

## Iteration

To solve some issues about the Usability test, we’ve made some changes in the Design screen, such as:

- In the first screen, we’ve added some descriptions about the app, to be able for the user to understand the app in the first moment before the Login.
- It was added a new field to confirm users passwords.
- On the checkboxes, next to the store description, where added an effect (Drop shadow) so that they are more visible for users.

## Solution & Impact Overview

During this process, we’ve made some more changes to our app. One of the things was the Accessibility “WebAIM” to see the contrast checker, and “Color tool - Material Design”. We added a new flow as well, where the user can return to the main screen after doing the Logout. To reduce users’ time we’ve added the option to Logout with Google Account.
