# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I am currently working as a Backend Engineer at Labtwin, we are building the first digital voice-powered lab assistant that aims to close the real-time documentation gap at the bench. It helps scientists document when their hands are busy by using voice, thus helping them focus on their work and not on tedious documentation, making scientists more awesome than they already are, creating and providing the lab of the future, by the way, we are hiring, check our [current openings](https://apply.workable.com/labtwin/)
