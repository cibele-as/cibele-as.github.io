# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>


Hello, I’m Cibele and I work as UI/UX Designer. I graduated as a Web Designer and Computer Science, where I worked directly with the customers deploying systems. With this experience, I could see the real customer’s needs and how important is to care about them. That’s why I decided to change my career and work in UI/UX Design. I have strong skills to communicate with customers and solve problems.

I love to travel, learn about new cultures, and learn new things.
